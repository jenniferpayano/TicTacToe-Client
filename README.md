PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
------------------------
To plan this game, I knew that I would a 3 by 3 dashboard that would represent each block in the hash table. From there I would then built a simple game logic, that determines the play of the game. After the game logic was completed, I created a dashboard form that would store the game information associated with the the user.


USER STORIES
------------
- As a player, I want to sign up to create an user.
- As a player, I want to sign in using the username and password I created with the sign up form
- As a player, once signed in I would want to click a button that would create a new game and associate it to my user.
- As a player, I want to see whose turn is it to play, so I can chose my next play.
- As a player, I want to place my input 'X' or 'O' on spot and see it be displayed.
- As a player, I want to know wether I won, lost or there was a draw to start a new game.
- As a player, I want to have a record of how many games I have played using my account.
